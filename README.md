[*SparkFun QwiicBus MidPoint (COM-18000)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18000)

The SparkFun QwiicBus MidPoint works in tandem with the [SparkFun QwiicBus EndPoint](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16988) to drop in I<sup>2</sup>C connections into a long-distance wired differential I<sup>2</sup>C bus. 
Featuring the PCA9615, the MidPoint translates a standard two-wire I<sup>2</sup>C signal to a 4-wire differential signal to allow long-distance and/or isolated wired buses. The board also includes a buck regulator that can be enabled to combat voltage drop over long distances as well as deliver more current to attached devices.
